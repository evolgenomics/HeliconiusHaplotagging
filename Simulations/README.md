# Simulations
The purpose of this repo is to allow users to simulate our "population haplotyping" pipeline under a range of diversity conditions.
The focal example we use here is from the *Heliconius erato* system. 

For the purpose of this simulation, we will be creating a 1 Mbp region, chosen from a putatively neutral, background location.
